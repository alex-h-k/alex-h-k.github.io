						<li>Core learning makes my study more efficient, it helped me to get to know myself better.</li>
						<li>2, What are 1 - 3 new things you have learned about yourself as a result of the core learning?</li>
						<li>First thing I learnt from core leanring was mindfulness training g, it really helped me to focus on the moment and reduced my anxiety.</li>
						<li>Second thing was Neuroplasticity and growth mindset, it keeps remind of me keeping trying and you will get there.</li>
						
						<li>3,What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</li>
						<li>Neuroplasticity and growth mindset, it is amzaing how our brian and develop and our ability to learn new things.</li>
						<li>4,What was the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</li>
						<li>The challenging of core learning for me is the process of taking time and exploring myself. For example, when we do our "identity,values and strengths activity", I never thought of my identity and values, strength. It is too abstract to me, I took some time to recall my past life experience and started to have a clear image of myself.</li>
				        <li>5,Any thoughts you want to share about your core learning journey in Foundations?</li>
						<li>To be honest, I've been really struggling during the whole foundations study. I'm a people person, I get used to having people around me and having instant respond from people, facing to computer whole day every day was a huge challenge for me. I got distracted very often during my foundation study, especially when I experienced some frustrating problem and got stuck.</li>
